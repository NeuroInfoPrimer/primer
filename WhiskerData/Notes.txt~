VPM cells juxtasomally recorded:
VPM_cell_37 - A2 monovibrissa RF
VPM_cell_57 - c4 monovibrissa RF

variables:
whiskparams - relevant fields are:
	samples - samples in which whisker position is calculated (upsampled to 1kHz from video rate)
	position - angle of vibrissa relative to face in each sample where position is calculated
	spikes - samples in which spikes detected
	iswhisking - samples where whisking is detected
	
 
Angle convention
angle = Center of mass of all vibrissae relative to middle of pad

-180 = fully retracted
-90  = perpendicular to pad
0    = fully protracted
