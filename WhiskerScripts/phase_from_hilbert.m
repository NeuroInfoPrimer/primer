    % Computationally, the Hilbert Transform is the Fourier
    % Transform with zero amplitude at all negative frequenices.  This
    % is equivalent to phase-shifting the time-domain signal by 90 degrees
    % at all frequencies and then adding this as an imaginary signal to the 
    % original signal.
    % So for example, the signal cos(t) becomes cos(t) + i sin(t).  
    %
    %The phase of the original signal is taken as the angle of this new
    %complex signal.
    %
    %inputs -  
    %    signal  - vector containing whisker angle
    %    Fs   - sampling rate (Hz)
    %    bp - frequency range for band-pass filtering
    %
    %outputs - 
    %    phase  - phase estimate from Hilbert transform
    %    filtered_signal - input signal after filtering
